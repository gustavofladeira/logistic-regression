# Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a logistic regression model from scratch using only NumPy, and to compare its performance with a pre-built model.

### Steps:

1. **Logistic Regression Implementation**:  
   I built the logistic regression algorithm step by step, which you can check [here](logistic_regression.ipynb).

2. **Model Testing**:  
   I tested the algorithm on a classification problem using a dataset from Kaggle. The full modeling and testing process is documented [here](modeling.ipynb).

### Results:

- The custom-built logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of `[...], while the model using a pre-built function achieved an accuracy of [...]`.

### Files:

- [logistic_regression.ipynb](logistic_regression.ipynb): Implementation of logistic regression from scratch.
- [modeling.ipynb](modeling.ipynb): Script for testing the custom algorithm on a classification problem and comparing it with a pre-built model.
